            What is realpricedata.com?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            realpricedata.com is a specialized price comparison engine that
            focuses on the &quot;price per unit&quot; (e.g., price per Terabyte,
            price per Gigabyte, or price per item). Unlike standard price
            comparison sites that just show the total price, we help you find
            the true best value by standardizing the cost across different
            package sizes and capacities.

          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            We automatically extract quantity information (like 2TB for an SSD
            or 32GB for a RAM kit) and divide the current market price by this
            amount. This gives you a comparable metric (like €/TB or €/GB) to
            easily spot which product offers the most value. We track these
            metrics daily to ensure you find the best deals.

            We use official APIs (like Amazon&apos;s Product Advertising API) to
            retrieve pricing and availability directly from major retailers.
            This ensures that the data we display is accurate and sourced
            directly from the merchant.

            Currently, our prices are updated every 24 hours. We are working on
            increasing this frequency to multiple times per day in the future.
            Because hardware markets (especially memory and storage) can be
            volatile, we always recommend clicking through to the retailer to
            verify the final price before checking out.

            The global memory market is currently undergoing a structural shift
            driven by the explosion of AI. Manufacturers are redirecting
            production capacity toward high-margin enterprise memory, reducing
            the supply for consumer-grade DDR4, DDR5, and SSDs. Read our full

            reviews for reliability before making a final decision.
