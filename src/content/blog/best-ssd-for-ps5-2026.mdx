faqs:
  - question: "What SSD specs does PS5 require?"
    answer: "PS5 requires an M.2 NVMe SSD with PCIe Gen 4 support, sequential read speed of 5,500 MB/s or faster, and 22mm width (2230, 2242, 2260, 2280, or 22110 length). Capacity can be 250GB to 4TB."
  - question: "Do I need a heatsink for my PS5 SSD?"
    answer: "Yes, a heatsink is recommended. Some SSDs come with one pre-installed. If yours doesn't, you'll need to add one. The total height with heatsink must be under 11.25mm to fit the PS5's expansion slot."
  - question: "Is 1TB or 2TB better for PS5?"
    answer: "2TB offers better price per TB value and more room for games. Modern PS5 games can be 50-100GB each, so 2TB lets you keep 15-20 games installed. 1TB is a budget-friendly option if you don't mind managing storage."
  - question: "Will a PCIe Gen 5 SSD work in PS5?"
    answer: "Yes, Gen 5 SSDs are backwards compatible with PS5's Gen 4 slot. However, you won't see any speed benefit over Gen 4 drives, so there's no reason to pay the Gen 5 premium for PS5 use."

## Installation Guide

Installing an SSD in PS5 takes about 5 minutes:

1. **Power off** your PS5 completely
2. **Remove** the side panel (white cover)
3. **Unscrew** the expansion slot cover
4. **Install** your SSD (with heatsink attached)
5. **Replace** the screw and covers
6. **Boot up** - PS5 will format the drive automatically

> **Important**: Some games can only run from internal storage. You can move games between drives anytime.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use an external SSD instead?

Yes, but with limitations. External USB SSDs can **store** PS5 games but cannot **run** them. You must transfer games to internal storage to play. External drives are great for PS4 games, which run directly from USB.

### Do I need the fastest SSD available?

No. Any SSD meeting the 5,500 MB/s requirement will perform identically in PS5. Faster drives (7,000+ MB/s) offer no benefit for console gaming—save money on a mid-tier drive.

### How long do SSDs last?

Modern NVMe SSDs have rated endurance of 600-1,200 TBW (terabytes written) for 2TB models. For typical gaming use (writing 50GB/day), this equals 30+ years of lifespan. Drive failure from age is extremely rare.

## Final Verdict

For most PS5 owners, a **2TB NVMe SSD** offers the best balance of capacity and value. The **[Samsung 990 Pro](/out/samsung-990-pro-2tb)** and **[WD Black SN850X](/out/wd-black-sn850x-2tb)** are proven performers, while the **[Crucial T705](/out/crucial-t705-ssd-2tb)** offers future-proofing if you also game on PC.
