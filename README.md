## ⚡ Built for Speed

CleverPrices is architected for maximum performance and efficiency, specifically optimized for the **Vercel Free Tier**:

- **Server Components & Caching** - Category grids and cards are 100% Server Components. This reduced client-side JavaScript by ~80% and allows for aggressive Edge caching.
- **Aggressive Field Pruning** - Heavy database fields (JSON specs, full price histories) are stripped before caching. This ensures category lists stay under the 2MB Vercel cache limit.
- **Tiered ISR (Revalidation)** - Distinct revalidation cycles for different data (e.g., 6h for Products, 11h for Categories, 24h for Static pages) balance data freshness with build/compute costs.
- **Native CSS Carousels** - No heavy JS libraries for sliders. Uses native browser `scroll-snap` for smooth 60fps scrolling with zero initial delay.
- **Amazon CDN Offloading** - Uses a custom Image Loader to request exact-sized images directly from Amazon. Zero server-side resizing costs or latency.
- **Edge Proxy Routing** - SEO redirects and legacy country enforcement happen at the network edge in ~10-20ms, bypassing the Node.js runtime entirely.
