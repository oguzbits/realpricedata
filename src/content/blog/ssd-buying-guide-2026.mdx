# The Ultimate SSD Buying Guide 2026

Storage has changed drastically in the last few years. Gone are the days when a mechanical Hard Disk Drive (HDD) was the standard for operating systems. Today, if you're building a PC or upgrading a laptop, a Solid State Drive (SSD) is mandatory for a responsive experience.

But with terms like NVMe, PCIe Gen 4, Gen 5, M.2, and SATA thrown around, it can be confusing to know exactly what you need—and what is a waste of money.

This guide clarifies everything and helps you calculate the true value of storage (Price per TB).

## The Three Main Types of Storage

### 1. NVMe SSDs (M.2) - The Gold Standard

**Best for:** Windows/OS, Gaming, Video Editing.

NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) drives look like stick of gum and plug directly into your motherboard. They use the PCIe interface (the same one your graphics card uses) to reach incredible speeds.

- **Speed:** 3,500 MB/s (Gen 3) to 12,000+ MB/s (Gen 5).
- **Price:** Moderate ($50 - $120 per TB).
- **Verdict:** **Buy this.** For 99% of users, a Gen 4 NVMe drive is the sweet spot in 2026.

### 2. SATA SSDs (2.5") - The Budget Savior

**Best for:** Game Libraries, Secondary Storage, Older Laptops.

Before NVMe took over, SATA SSDs were the kings. They look like small rectangular boxes and connect via cables. They are limited by the older SATA interface speed cap (~560 MB/s).

- **Speed:** ~550 MB/s.
- **Price:** Low/Moderate ($40 - $80 per TB).
- **Verdict:** Good for mass storage or reviving old PCs that don't have M.2 slots.

### 3. HDDs (Mechanical Hard Drives) - The Data Hoarder

**Best for:** Backups, NAS, Media Servers, Security Footage.

These contain spinning magnetic platters. They are slow, noisy, and fragile compared to SSDs. However, they are incredibly cheap for massive capacities (8TB, 16TB, 20TB).

- **Speed:** ~150 - 250 MB/s.
- **Price:** Very Low ($15 - $25 per TB).
- **Verdict:** Only buy an HDD if you need more than 4TB of cheap storage for files you don't access often. **Never install Windows on an HDD in 2026.**

## Technical Specs That Actually Matter

When comparing SSDs on CleverPrices, don't just look at the price. Look at these three specs:

### 1. Sequential Read/Write Speed

This is the big number on the box (e.g., "7300 MB/s"). It matters for copying huge files, but for gaming, the difference between 3500 MB/s and 7300 MB/s is often just a second or two in loading times.

### 2. Endurance (TBW)

**TBW = Terabytes Written.** This tells you how much data you can write to the drive before the warranty expires.

- **Good:** 600 TBW for a 1TB drive (Standard)
- **Great:** 1200+ TBW (Pro/Endurance focus)

### 3. DRAM Cache (The Secret Sauce)

Cheaper NVMe drives are often "DRAM-less." They use a tiny portion of your system RAM or slow flash memory to map files.

- **With DRAM:** Faster, more durable, better for OS drives (e.g., Samsung 990 Pro, WD SN850X).
- **DRAM-less:** Cheaper, fine for secondary game drives (e.g., WD SN770, Lexar NM790).

## 2026 Recommendations by Budget

We track hundreds of prices daily to calculate the **Price Per TB**. Here are the current value champions:

### Best High-End (Gen 5/Gen 4 NVMe)

**Samsung 990 Pro / Crucial T700 (Gen 5)**
If you want the best performance for your high-end PC, these drives consistently offer top-tier speed and reliability.

### Best Value (Gen 4 NVMe)

**Lexar NM790 / WD Black SN770**
These drives often cost 20-30% less than the top tier but deliver 90% of the real-world performance. Excellent for gaming libraries.

### Best SATA SSD (Legacy)

**Crucial MX500 / Samsung 870 EVO**
The most reliable choices for 2.5" slots. They have DRAM caches and excellent longevity.

## Summary: What size do I need?

- **1TB:** The absolute minimum for a gaming PC. Windows takes ~60GB, and modern games like Call of Duty can take 200GB+ alone.
- **2TB:** **The Sweet Spot.** Prices for 2TB drives have dropped significantly, often offering better value per TB than 1TB drives.
- **4TB:** Premium territory. Expect to pay a "density tax" (higher price per TB), although gaps are closing in 2026.
